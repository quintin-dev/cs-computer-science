## What Is Computer Science ?

Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. It involves understanding the theory, design, development, and application of software and systems. The field encompasses a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, programming languages, software engineering, artificial intelligence, and more.

## What Is Software Engineering ?

Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software. It involves a systematic approach to software development, including requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. Software engineers use various methodologies and tools to ensure that software is reliable, efficient, and meets user needs.

## What Is Programming ?

Programming is the process of designing and building executable computer software to accomplish a specific task. It involves writing code in a programming language, which is then compiled or interpreted to create a program that can be run on a computer. Programming is a key aspect of computer science and is used to create applications, websites, games, and more.

## What Is Coding ?

Coding is the act of writing instructions for a computer to follow. It is often used interchangeably with programming, but it can also refer specifically to the process of translating human-readable code into machine-readable code. Coding involves using a programming language to create algorithms and data structures that can be executed by a computer.
